The Glass dataset is used to classify different types of glass based on their chemical properties. This dataset includes various features representing the chemical composition of glass samples.

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Understanding the Dataset
2. Data Structure: Perform an exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and distribution of the dataset.
3.Missing Values: Check for any missing values and assess the impact they might have on the analysis.
4. Outliers: Identify and analyze outliers to ensure they do not adversely affect the model's performance.
5. Inconsistencies: Look for any inconsistencies in the data and address them before moving to the modeling stage.
### 2. Data Visualization
1. Visual Exploration
2. Histograms and Box Plots: Create visualizations like histograms and box plots to understand the distribution of each feature.
3. Pair Plots: Generate pair plots to explore relationships between different features.
4. Correlation Analysis: Analyze patterns and correlations observed in the data to inform feature selection and model tuning.
### 3. Data Preprocessing
1. Handling Missing Values
Imputation or Removal: Check for missing values and implement a strategy (such as imputation or removal) to handle them. Document the reasoning behind the chosen approach.
2. Encoding Categorical Variables
3. Categorical Encoding: Apply encoding techniques like one-hot encoding to convert any categorical variables into numerical format.
Feature Scaling
4. Scaling Techniques: Apply feature scaling techniques such as standardization or normalization to ensure that all features are on a similar scale, which is crucial for the performance of the Random Forest model.
Handling Imbalanced Data
